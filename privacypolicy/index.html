        <h1>Privacy Policy for SaneGames</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 22, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to SaneGames ("us", "we", or "our")! We operate the website <a href="https://sanegames.elouan.xyz/">https://sanegames.elouan.xyz/</a> (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, and subject to your choices regarding cookies and tracking as described in our cookie notice and herein, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

        <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
        <h4>a. Personal Data We Collect Directly</h4>
        <p>SaneGames itself does not directly request or require you to submit personally identifiable information like your name or email address to use the core features of the Service. If you choose to contact us directly (e.g., via email if a contact method is provided elsewhere), we would then collect the information you voluntarily provide in that communication.</p>

        <h4>b. Usage Data & Cookies (Primarily via PostHog)</h4>
        <p>When you access the Service and if you consent to analytics cookies, we, through our analytics provider PostHog, may collect certain information automatically ("Usage Data"). This may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Protocol (IP) address (PostHog may process this to determine general location and may offer anonymization features)</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Device type and operating system</li>
            <li>Pages of our Service that you visit</li>
            <li>The time and date of your visit</li>
            <li>The time spent on those pages</li>
            <li>Referring/exit pages</li>
            <li>Clicks, scrolls, and other interactions with the Service</li>
            <li>Unique identifiers assigned by PostHog for analytics purposes</li>
            <li>Screen resolution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Service if you provide consent for such technologies via our cookie consent banner.</p>

        <h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>We use cookies for the following purposes, subject to your consent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are strictly necessary for the Service to function (e.g., to load basic site features). These do not require consent but are mentioned for transparency.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies (including Consent):</strong> We use a cookie to remember your cookie consent preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies (PostHog):</strong> If you consent, we use PostHog to help us understand how our Service is being used. This helps us improve your experience and the functionality of SaneGames.
                <ul>
                    <li>We use a self-hosted instance of PostHog for product analytics, with data collection routed through <code>https://posthog.elouan.xyz</code>. PostHog helps us understand user behavior such as page views, clicks, feature usage, and session interactions. PostHog may collect data points as listed under "Usage Data" above. The PostHog user interface, which we may use to analyze this data, is hosted by PostHog at <code>https://us.posthog.com</code>. You can learn more about PostHog's general privacy practices at <a href="https://posthog.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://posthog.com/privacy</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You provided consent for non-essential cookies via our cookie banner. You can typically change your cookie preferences by clearing cookies in your browser for our site (<code>sanegames.elouan.xyz</code>), which should cause the consent banner to reappear on your next visit, allowing you to make a new choice.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>SaneGames uses the collected Usage Data (via PostHog, with your consent) for purposes such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve our Service</li>
            <li>To understand how users interact with SaneGames</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our Service and identify popular games or features</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues or bugs</li>
            <li>To analyze trends and gather insights for future development</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), SaneGames' legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
        <p>We may process your Personal Data because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have given us **consent** to do so (this is the primary basis for processing data via PostHog analytics cookies).</li>
            <li>The processing is in our **legitimate interests** for essential website operation and security, and it's not overridden by your rights.</li>
            <li>To comply with the law (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain Usage Data collected via PostHog according to the configurations of our self-hosted PostHog instance and subject to PostHog's data processing capabilities. We aim to retain this data only for as long as it is necessary for the analytical purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Your cookie consent choices are stored in a cookie for up to 1 year, after which you may be asked for consent again.</p>

        <h2>5. Transfer of Data</h2>
        <p>Usage Data collected via PostHog is sent to our self-hosted instance at <code>https://posthog.elouan.xyz</code>. If this server is located outside your jurisdiction, your data will be transferred there. Furthermore, we may access and analyze this data using PostHog's cloud-hosted user interface at <code>https://us.posthog.com</code> (located in the United States). PostHog employs safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses for such international data transfers and processing where applicable.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy, and your consent to analytics cookies, represents your agreement to such transfers if they occur.</p>
        <p>SaneGames will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclosure of Data</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p>We may disclose Usage Data in an aggregated or de-identified form for analytical or statistical purposes. We may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</p>

        <h2>7. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use PostHog as a third-party Service Provider to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PostHog:</strong> As described, PostHog provides product analytics services. Their processing of data is governed by our instructions (as the data controller for our instance) and their own terms and privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain data protection rights. SaneGames aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of any Personal Data we might hold about you (which, for SaneGames, is primarily Usage Data linked to identifiers set by PostHog).</p>

        <h3>General Rights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent (e.g., for analytics cookies), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can do this by clearing your browser cookies for our site to make the consent banner reappear or by using any specific opt-out mechanisms we may provide.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have specific GDPR rights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access, update, or delete the information PostHog holds that may be associated with you (subject to PostHog's capabilities and our ability to identify your data).</li>
            <li>The right of rectification if that information is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
            <li>The right to object to our processing of your Personal Data (primarily by not consenting or withdrawing consent for analytics).</li>
            <li>The right of restriction on processing your Personal Data.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability for information you provided to us (likely not applicable as we don't collect direct submissions from you).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you are a resident of California (CCPA/CPRA):</h3>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Know what personal information is being collected about you (as described in this policy).</li>
            <li>Access your personal information (we will endeavor to provide access to Usage Data associated with you, subject to identification and PostHog's capabilities).</li>
            <li>Delete your personal information (we will endeavor to delete Usage Data associated with you, subject to identification and PostHog's capabilities).</li>
            <li>Opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. SaneGames does not "sell" your personal information or "share" it for cross-context behavioral advertising. Our use of PostHog is for internal analytics to improve our Service. However, you can opt-out of this analytics tracking by declining consent via our cookie banner or by using PostHog's opt-out mechanism if you have previously consented (see below).</li>
            <li>Non-discrimination for exercising your CCPA rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise your rights, or if you wish to opt-out of PostHog tracking after initially consenting, you can contact us at [Your Support Email, e.g., privacy@sanegames.elouan.xyz - REPLACE THIS]. We may also implement PostHog's specific opt-out functions; if so, details will be provided here or via our cookie management tool. Alternatively, clearing your cookies for our site will allow you to make a new consent choice.</p>

        <h2>9. Security of Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us. We utilize a self-hosted PostHog instance to have more control over the collected analytics data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>10. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service contains links to games hosted on third-party websites (e.g., CrazyGames). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or a higher age of digital consent if applicable in your jurisdiction, e.g., 16 in some parts of the EU). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data (for instance, if PostHog inadvertently collected data from a user identified as a child), please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our systems.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
